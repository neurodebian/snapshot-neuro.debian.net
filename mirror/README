To sync the farm to a mirror, we can run full rsyncs for instance.  However
these are expensive and thus we would like to avoid having to do that often.

Since the farm has a pretty specific structure, and files once in the farm
never change, we can also do the following on a mirror:
  Compile a list of all local and remote files or files with a specific
  prefix, compare the lists, and directly fetch/push any the mirror does
  not have.

We have a set of scripts that help implement this:
.    make a temporary directory, cd there,
.
.    farm-list-entries 00 |
.      ssh master farm-make-update-tarball 00 |
.      tar xaf -
.    process-farm-update
.
.    rm -rf temporary directory

See sync-farm-incremental for the actual implementation.


Other scripts in this directory:
 - ssh-wrap:
   ssh authorized_keys command wrapper/dispatcher script

 - sync-farm-completely: 
   Runs one rsync each for all 256 top-level directories.

 - sync-incremental:
   Triggered from the master, run on the client, will run
   farm-journal-fetch-tarball and import any new dumps.

 - farm-journal-make-tarball,
   farm-journal-fetch-tarball,
   farm-journal-expire:
   A different way to keep mirrors in sync is to keep a journal of added
   files on the master.  Then we only need to consult this list and copy
   the new files over to the client when we have updates.  These scripts
   implement that behavior, and also expire old journal entries.

 - import-new-dumps:
   Prior to postgres replication, we would dump out mirrorruns to flat
   files, ship these to the mirror which would then import it.  This
   script is the importer.
